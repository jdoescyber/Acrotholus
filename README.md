# Acrotholus
 
Acrotholus aims to speed up OSINT by checking artifacts against APIs. Acrotholus uses as many (reliable) open APIs as it can,
meaning it's meant to supported APIs that don't need an API key. **Some services with free API keys, like AbuseIPDB, URLScan, 
and Hybrid-Analysis are supported, too**.

## APIs

### Currently Supported

- ThreatCrowd (IPs, Domains, Hashes)

### Roadmap

- Alienvault OTX
- AbuseIPDB
- URLScan
- Hybrid-Analysis
- Shodan
